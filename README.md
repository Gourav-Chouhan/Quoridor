# Quoridor

<hr>

### Quoridor is a realtime multipalyer board game played between 2 players

#### Do you know what I love about this award-winning game? Quoridor one of those games that can be explained in less 10 minutes and yet it remains challenging and fun. Just to prove it to you, I’m going to explain the game in two sentences:

##### The object of the game is to get your pawn to the opposite side of the board before your opponent(s).

##### On each turn, you may either move your pawn one square or place a wooden fence on the board to re-route your opponent.

##### Sounds simple, right? Wrong! Folks, it’s so fun. Your children will have such a blast playing this strategy game that they won’t realize they are learning, and adults will feel equally challenged.
